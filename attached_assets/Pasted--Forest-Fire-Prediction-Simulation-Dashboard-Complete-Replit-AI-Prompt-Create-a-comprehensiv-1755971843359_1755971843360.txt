# Forest Fire Prediction & Simulation Dashboard - Complete Replit AI Prompt

Create a comprehensive single-page scrollable web dashboard for a forest fire prediction and simulation system called "NeuroNix" with the following specifications:

## Project Overview
Build an interactive single-page dashboard for forest fire disaster management that combines AI-powered fire risk prediction with real-time fire spread simulation. The system should demonstrate early intervention capabilities through geospatial analysis and automated alerts, specifically focused on Uttarakhand state, India.

## Dashboard Layout Structure
- **Single-page scrollable layout** with smooth scroll navigation
- **Fixed header** with navigation menu that scrolls to different sections
- **Full-screen sections** that stack vertically
- **Sticky navigation** that highlights current section while scrolling

## Core Features Required

### 1. Header Section
- **Fixed Header**: "NeuroNix - Forest Fire Prediction & Simulation Dashboard"
- **Smooth Scroll Navigation Menu**: Home, Fire Risk Prediction, Fire Spread Simulation, Alerts, Data Sources, Analytics
- **Navigation should scroll to respective sections** when clicked

### 2. Fire Risk Prediction Section
- **Map Visualization**: Interactive map showing fire risk zones with color coding:
  - Green: Low Risk
  - Yellow: Moderate Risk  
  - Orange: High Risk
  - Red: Very High Risk
- **Risk Prediction Panel**: Display current fire risk levels for selected areas
- **Model Information**: Show AI-powered prediction system with high accuracy
- **Algorithm Details**: Display "Advanced Neural Network Model" instead of technical terms
- **Next-day Prediction**: Toggle to show predicted fire risk for the next day

### 3. Fire Spread Simulation Section
- **Simulation Controls**: 
  - Play/Pause/Reset buttons
  - Speed control slider
  - Time display (Hour-wise: 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 6 hours)
- **Interactive Fire Spread Model**: 
  - Click anywhere on the map to start a fire simulation
  - Animated visualization showing how fire would spread from that point
  - Uses Cellular Automata (CA) - map divided into small cells that change from Unburned → Burning → Burned
  - Fire spreads from burning cells to neighboring cells based on environmental conditions
- **Real-time Parameters Display**: 
  - Wind speed and direction (affects fire spread speed and direction)
  - Temperature and humidity (affects fire intensity)
  - Terrain slope (fire spreads faster uphill)
  - Vegetation density (denser forests burn faster)
- **Visual Elements**:
  - Red/orange areas = Currently burning zones
  - Dark red/black areas = Already burned areas
  - Moving fire front edge showing active spread direction

### 4. Data Sources Panel
Create input indicators for:
- **Satellite Data**: MODIS, Sentinel-2 (with satellite icons)
- **Weather Data**: ERA5 (ECMWF)
- **Vegetation**: NDVI from Sentinel-2
- **Terrain**: SRTM DEM (NASA)
- **Human Activity**: GHSL, OSM
- Show real-time data ingestion status with green/red indicators

### 5. Alert System
- **Alert Dashboard**: List of current active alerts
- **Alert Types**: 
  - Fire Risk Warnings
  - Active Fire Detected
  - Evacuation Recommendations
- **GIS Integration**: Show alerts on map with location markers
- **Export Options**: "Export GeoTIFF / Shapefiles for Govt use"

### 6. System Performance Display
- **Model Performance**: Show accuracy metrics and prediction confidence
- **Processing Status**: Real-time system status indicators
- **Coverage Area**: Display monitored regions and active sensors

### 7. Analytics Dashboard
- **Performance Metrics**: Model accuracy (97%), Prediction reliability
- **Coverage Statistics**: Areas monitored, Alerts generated, Successful interventions
- **Historical Data**: Past fire incidents and prediction accuracy
- **Real-time Graphs**: Risk levels over time, Environmental conditions

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- Use HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
- Interactive maps (use Leaflet.js or similar)
- Charts and graphs (use Chart.js or D3.js)
- Real-time data simulation (use setInterval for demo purposes)

### Styling
- **Color Scheme**: Dark blue background (#1a1a2e), bright blue accents (#16213e), orange/red for fire elements
- **Modern UI**: Glassmorphism effects, smooth animations, gradient backgrounds
- **Cards/Panels**: Rounded corners, subtle shadows, semi-transparent backgrounds
- **Typography**: Clean, modern fonts with good contrast

### Interactive Elements
- Clickable map regions that show detailed information
- Hover effects on all interactive elements
- Modal windows for detailed views
- Animated transitions between states
- Loading animations for data processing

### Demo Data
Since this is for demonstration:
- Create sample fire risk data for different regions within Uttarakhand
- Generate mock real-time weather data specific to Uttarakhand climate
- Simulate fire spread patterns with realistic animations for forest areas in Uttarakhand
- Use actual coordinates for major cities and forest areas in Uttarakhand
- Create sample alert notifications for various districts of Uttarakhand

## Specific Implementation Details

### Map Component
```javascript
// Include interactive map showing Uttarakhand, India with:
- Base layer with terrain/satellite imagery of Uttarakhand
- Fire risk zones with color-coded overlays across Uttarakhand districts
- Real-time fire locations in forest areas (simulated)
- Weather station markers across major cities
- Clickable regions for detailed district/area information
- Forest boundaries and national parks (Jim Corbett, Valley of Flowers, etc.)
```

### Simulation Engine
```javascript
// Create cellular automata simulation showing:
- Fire spread patterns based on wind direction
- Terrain effects on fire behavior
- Real-time progression with time controls
- Visual effects like particle systems for flames
```

### Alert System
```javascript
// Implement notification system with:
