Graph Addition for NeuroNix Dashboard
Add the following interactive charts and graphs to the Analytics Dashboard section:
Required Charts:
1. Fire Risk Level Over Time (Line Chart)

Multi-line graph showing fire risk changes throughout the day/week
X-axis: Time (hours/days)
Y-axis: Risk level (0-100% or Low/Moderate/High/Very High)
Different colored lines for major regions in Uttarakhand (Dehradun, Nainital, Haridwar, Rishikesh)
Real-time updating with smooth animations
Hover tooltips showing exact risk values and timestamps
Legend to identify different regions

2. Fire Spread Simulation Timeline (Area Chart)

Area chart showing burned area expansion over time during simulation
X-axis: Time progression (1hr, 2hr, 3hr, 6hr intervals)
Y-axis: Area burned (in hectares)
Gradient fill from orange to deep red showing fire intensity
Updates dynamically when fire simulation is running
Toggle options to switch between different simulation scenarios
Smooth transitions when data updates

3. Model Accuracy & Performance (Gauge Charts)

Three circular gauge charts:

Prediction accuracy gauge (showing 97%)
System uptime percentage gauge
Data processing speed indicator


Color-coded performance indicators:

Green: Good performance (80-100%)
Yellow: Warning (60-79%)
Red: Critical (below 60%)


Animated needle movements and percentage counters
Digital display showing exact values

4. Alert Statistics (Pie Chart)

Interactive pie chart showing distribution of alert types
Categories:

Fire Risk Warnings (35%)
Active Fire Detected (25%)
Evacuation Alerts (20%)
All Clear/Safe Zones (20%)


Color-coded segments with distinct colors for each category
Interactive segments that show detailed information on hover/click
Legend with alert counts and percentages
Real-time updates as new alerts are generated
Animation when chart loads or updates

Chart Specifications:

Use Chart.js or similar charting library for all graphs
Responsive design - charts should resize for mobile/tablet
Consistent color scheme matching the dashboard theme (dark blue background, orange/red for fire elements)
Smooth animations for all chart interactions and updates
Professional styling with clean typography and proper spacing
Interactive tooltips for all charts showing detailed information

Sample Data Generation:

Fire Risk Data: Generate realistic hourly/daily risk patterns showing peak hours (afternoon) and safer periods (early morning)
Simulation Data: Create progressive area expansion data showing realistic fire spread rates
Performance Metrics: Maintain consistent high accuracy (95-99%) with occasional minor fluctuations
Alert Distribution: Realistic proportions with more warnings than actual fire detections

Layout:

Grid layout arranging all 4 charts in a visually appealing 2x2 or responsive layout
Chart titles and descriptions for each visualization
Proper spacing between charts for clean appearance
Mobile responsive - stack charts vertically on smaller screens
